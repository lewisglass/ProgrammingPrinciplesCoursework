This program was made using python 3.14.0. Although it may be runable on earlier versions, this was the earliest version tested.

To run this program ensure the correct python version is installed. 
Then either run the run.bat file on windows or open the command window and open the working directory eg. cd C:\your\directory\. 
Then use either python main.py or py main.py depending on your installation.
if you wish to run the unit tests repeat the same process but for bridge_manamgement_system_test.py.
